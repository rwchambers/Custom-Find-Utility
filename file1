'tty' stands for teletype, an archaic synonym for terminal
UNIX API calls have detailed information in their man pages
grep is an invaluable pattern mathing tool for searches within contents of files
Shells and Terminals are not the same thing, shells run within a terminal
Bash (i.e. Bourne-Again Shell) is derived from the Bourne Shell (i.e. sh)
open(), read(), write() are system calls whereas printf() and scanf() are C library functions
The write() system call writes bytes of data and has no facility for formatting output
